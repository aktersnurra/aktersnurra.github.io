A deep learning project for recognizing handwritten text.


# Motivation

Implementing the text recognizer project from the course 
["Full Stack Deep Learning Course"](https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/march2019) (FSDL) in PyTorch
in order to learn best practices when building a deep learning project. I have expanded on this 
project by adding additional feature and ideas given by Claudio Jolowicz 
in ["Hypermodern Python"](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/).
